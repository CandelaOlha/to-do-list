# To-do list

## About this project

This is a small project I made to test my knowledge of Javascript and improve my skills as a frontend developer.

It is a simple to-do list that allows the user to add, edit and delete tasks.

To add a further degree of complexity to the project, I used local storage to save user tasks and their status.
